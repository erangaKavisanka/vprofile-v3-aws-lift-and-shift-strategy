# 🚀 Production-Style vProfile Cloud Migration on AWS (Lift & Shift)

A production-style migration of the **vProfile multi-tier Java application** to **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** using the **Lift & Shift** migration strategy. This project focuses on building a scalable, highly available, and secure cloud architecture while minimizing application changes during migration.

---

## 📖 Overview

The original vProfile application was deployed on traditional virtual machines. This project migrates the application to AWS while preserving its architecture and enhancing it with cloud-native capabilities such as:

- High Availability
- Auto Scaling
- Load Balancing
- Secure Networking
- Centralized Artifact Storage
- DNS-based Service Discovery

The deployment closely resembles a production environment using core AWS services.

# 🏛️ Architecture Components

## 🌐 DNS Layer

- Public domain configured using GoDaddy
- Amazon Route 53 manages DNS resolution
- Traffic routed securely to the Application Load Balancer

---

## ⚖️ Load Balancer

Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- Receives HTTPS requests
- Distributes traffic across multiple Tomcat instances
- Performs health checks
- Improves application availability

---

## 🚀 Application Tier

- Apache Tomcat deployed on EC2
- Multiple instances managed by Auto Scaling Group
- Automatically scales based on demand
- Downloads application artifacts from Amazon S3

---

## 📦 Storage Layer

Amazon S3 is used for

- WAR artifacts
- Deployment packages
- Centralized artifact management

---

## 🔐 Private Backend Services

Dedicated EC2 instances host

- MySQL Database
- RabbitMQ Message Broker
- Memcached Cache

Backend services communicate through a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone and are not publicly accessible.

---

## 🛡️ Security

Security Groups isolate every application layer.

- Internet → ALB (HTTPS)
- ALB → Tomcat (8080)
- Tomcat → MySQL
- Tomcat → RabbitMQ
- Tomcat → Memcached

No backend service is directly exposed to the Internet.
